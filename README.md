# human-detection-model
Binary image classifier using deep convolutional network (Tensorflow)
Machine Learning model for detecting if a given image is of a human or not. I've used Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 1.9.0 with appropriate Numpy, SciPy and Scikit-learn models. The network has 3 convolutional layers, a flatten layer and a fully connected layer. The network takes a large dataset of labeled images of humans and not-humans to produce a binary output.
